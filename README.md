**Report on Breast Cancer Data Analysis and Classification**

**Objective:**
The primary objective of this task was to perform exploratory data analysis and implement a classification model to predict breast cancer diagnosis (Malignant or Benign) using a publicly available dataset.

**1. Data Loading and Preliminary Inspection:**
The dataset consisted of 569 entries and 33 columns. Initial inspection revealed that the `diagnosis` column served as the target variable, containing categorical values 'M' (Malignant) and 'B' (Benign). This column was subsequently encoded into binary format (M=1, B=0).

**2. Data Cleaning:**

* An unused column labeled `Unnamed: 32` with all null values was dropped.
* Duplicate rows were removed.
* Outliers in the `radius_mean` column were handled using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
* No missing values were found in the dataset after cleaning.

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

* Summary statistics were computed for all numerical features.
* Class distribution revealed 357 benign and 212 malignant cases.
* Boxplots and heatmaps were utilized to detect feature distributions, outliers, and correlations. A heatmap of the correlation matrix provided insights into feature relationships.

**4. Data Preparation:**

* The dataset was split into training and test sets (80:20 ratio).
* Features were standardized using `StandardScaler` to normalize the input data for better model performance.

**5. Model Training and Evaluation:**

* A Logistic Regression model was trained on the processed data.
* Evaluation metrics were computed:

  * **Precision:** High precision indicated a low false positive rate.
  * **Recall:** High recall confirmed a low false negative rate.
  * **ROC-AUC Score:** Demonstrated good discriminatory ability of the classifier.
* A confusion matrix was plotted to visualize the model’s classification performance.

**6. Threshold Optimization:**

* Various thresholds were tested to optimize the F1-score.
* A Precision-Recall curve was plotted to analyze trade-offs.
* The optimal threshold was selected based on the highest F1-score, and corresponding precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 values were reported.

**7. ROC Curve and Sigmoid Function:**

* The ROC curve demonstrated a strong area under the curve (AUC), reinforcing the model’s reliability.
* A sigmoid curve was plotted to illustrate the transformation of linear outputs into probability scores in logistic regression.
